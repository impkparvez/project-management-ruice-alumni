## üìã Step 3: Create Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

Detailed documentation that covers:

- Project overview
- Use case diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- Business rules
- API plan with versioning and rate-limiting
- Security and compliance requirements

## üåÄ Step 4: Choose Development Model

- **Agile (Scrum)**
  - Create `sprints` (2-week cycle)
  - Define Epics ‚Üí User Stories ‚Üí Tasks
  - Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers, QA, UI/UX Designer

## üìù Jira Project Setup

1. **Configure Project Settings**

   - Go to Project Settings.
   - Set up:
     - Issue Types (Epic, Story, Task, Bug) `DONE BY DEFAULT`
     - Workflows (simplify or customize per your needs)
     - Screens (if needed)
     - Fields (custom fields like "Assumptions" if required)
     - Permissions (for team members)

2. **Set Up Agile Board (Scrum)**

   - If not created automatically:
     - Go to Boards ‚Üí Create Board ‚Üí Scrum Board.
     - Link it to your project.

3. **Add Epics**

   - Use the `Backlog` view.
   - Create Epics based on your core modules (Authentication, Admin Dashboard, etc.).

4. **Create User Stories**

   - Under each Epic, create Stories with:
     - Title.
     - Description (include User Story, Assumption, Acceptance Criteria).
     - Story Points.
     - Priority.
   - Attach files or link documentation if necessary.

5. **Prioritize the Backlog**

   - Drag and order stories based on importance and dependencies.
   - Add labels or components to group features (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `testing`).

6. **Create Sprints**

   - Click `Create Sprint` in the backlog.
   - Add stories from the backlog to this sprint.
   - Estimate velocity (based on previous experience or assume team capacity in points).
   - Example:
     - Sprint 1: Authentication, User Registration, Profile.
     - Sprint 2: Event Creation.
     - Sprint 3: New Task.

7. **Start the Sprint**

   - Set sprint name, goal, and duration (2 weeks is standard).
   - Click `Start Sprint`.

8. **Daily Scrum (Standups)**

   - Use Jira to check current progress.
   - Move tasks across columns: To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review ‚Üí Done.

9. **Sprint Review**

   - End sprint and review completed vs. incomplete tasks.
   - Get feedback from stakeholders.

10. **Sprint Retrospective**
    - Conduct a retro:
      - What went well?
      - What didn't?
      - What to improve next sprint?
    - Add action items to the backlog if needed.
