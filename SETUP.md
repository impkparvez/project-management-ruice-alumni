- **Frontend Components:** Broken down by module
- **Middlewares:** Auth, error handling, rate-limiting, logging

---

## 🗃️ Database Modeling

### ✅ 1. Identify Entities and Relationships

**Core Collections:**
- `users` – Alumni, Students, Faculty, Staff, Admins
- `events` – Alumni meetups, webinars
- `jobs` – Job postings shared by alumni
- `messages` – Direct communication
- `connections` – Mentorship or friend links
- `donations` – Contributions by alumni
- `logs` – System audit logs

### ✅ 2. Sample Schema Design

#### Example: `User` Schema
```js
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String,
  role: ['alumni', 'student', 'faculty', 'admin'],
  graduationYear: Number,
  department: String,
  bio: String,
  profilePicture: String,
  connections: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Example: `Event` Schema
```js
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  date: Date,
  location: String,
  createdBy: ObjectId,
  attendees: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### ✅ 3. Diagramming Tools
- dbdiagram.io
- drawSQL
- MongoDB Compass
- NoSQL Workbench

### ✅ 4. Relationship Mapping
- One-to-Many: User → Events, User → Jobs
- Many-to-Many: Users ↔ Connections
- One-to-One: User ↔ Profile

### ✅ 5. Indexing Strategy
- Index on `email` (unique)
- Compound index for sorting: `graduationYear + department`
- Text index on bios and job descriptions

### ✅ 6. Data Validation
- In DB: Mongoose validation
- In API Layer: Zod / Joi

---

## 🌍 Environment Configuration

### ✅ Environment Setup
- Create `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`
- Use `dotenv` for backend and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` vars for frontend

Example:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_uri
JWT_SECRET=supersecret
```

---

## 🛠️ PHASE 3: Development

### 🔁 Sprint Planning
- 2-week sprints
- Daily standups
- Sprint review/retrospective

### 📋 Sample Epics & User Stories

| Epic        | User Story                                   |

---

## 🔐 PHASE 5: Security & Optimization

- HTTPS, Helmet, CORS
- Input Sanitization
- Rate Limiting
- MongoDB optimization
- Optional: Redis Caching
- **Advanced Security Measures:**
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for vulnerability scanning
  - Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Regular dependency vulnerability scans (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk)
  - Secure sensitive environment variables using tools like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault

---

## 🚀 PHASE 6: Deployment & DevOps

### 🔧 Production Build
- React: `npm run build`
- Backend: Transpile TS (if used)
- **Additional Steps:**
  - Use Docker for containerization
  - Multi-stage Docker builds for smaller production images
  - Use PM2 or a similar process manager for backend
  - Enable gzip or Brotli compression for frontend assets

### 🚢 Environments
- `dev`, `staging`, `production`
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
  - Set up environment-specific configurations using `.env` files or secrets management

### 🔄 CI/CD
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Lint → Test → Build → Deploy
- **Enhancements:**
  - Add automated security checks in CI/CD pipeline
  - Use Canary Deployments or Blue-Green Deployments for safer rollouts
  - Integrate with monitoring tools for post-deployment validation
