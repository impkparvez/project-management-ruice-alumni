# 🎓 Alumni Information Management System

## ✅ Project Overview

**Project Name:** AIMS - Alumni Information Management System

**Goal:** Build a full-featured monolithic web application to manage alumni engagement, events, job opportunities, and more.

---

## 🔁 PHASE 1: Planning & Requirement Analysis

### 🎯 Key Activities

- Identify Stakeholders: Faculty, Alumni, Students, Staffs, IT Staff
- Conduct Interviews, Surveys, and Questionnaires
- Perform Competitior Analysis (e.g., alumni portals at top universities)

### ✅ Deliverables

- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Use Case Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- User Stories (Agile Format)
- Early API Plan
- Assumptions & Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria

## 🌀 Step 1: Project Scope

- **Problem Statement:** Lack of centralized platform for alumni to engage with institution and each other.
- **Target Users:** Alumni, Current Students, Faculty, Staff, System Admins.
- **SMART Goals:**
  - Specific: Alumni engagement and resource sharing
  - Measurable: 1000+ user registrations within 6 months
  - Achievable: Use open-source tools and agile team
  - Relevant: Supports career growth and community
  - Time-bound: MVP in 3 months

## 🌀 Step 2: Choose Development Model

- **Agile (Scrum)**
  - Create `sprints` (2-week cycle)
  - Define Epics → User Stories → Tasks
  - Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers, QA, UI/UX Designer

## 📋 Step 3: Requirements Gathering

### ✅ Functional Requirements

- Alumni registration & login
- Profile management
- Event creation & RSVP
- Job board
- Messaging system
- Admin dashboard with analytics

### ✅ Non-Functional Requirements

- Security (JWT, RBAC)
- Performance optimization
- Audit logs
- Scalability within monolithic scope

## 📋 Step 4: Create Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

Detailed documentation that covers:

- Project overview
- Use case diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- Business rules
- Early API plan

## 🎨 PHASE 2: System Design

## 🗃️ Step 1: Database Design

✅ Use MongoDB (NoSQL)

- Create ER Diagrams or Logical Data Models
- Normalize where necessary
- Identify collection, indexes, relationships

**Tools:** dbdiagram.io, Draw.io, Lucidchart

### ✅ 1. Identify Entities and Relationships

**Core Collections:**

- `users` – Alumni, Students, Faculty, Staff, Admins
- `events` – Alumni meetups, webinars
- `jobs` – Job postings shared by alumni
- `messages` – Direct communication
- `connections` – Mentorship or friend links
- `donations` – Contributions by alumni
- `logs` – System audit logs

### ✅ 2. Sample Schema Design

#### Example: `User` Schema

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String,
  role: ['alumni', 'student', 'faculty', 'admin'],
  graduationYear: Number,
  department: String,
  bio: String,
  profilePicture: String,
  connections: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Example: `Event` Schema

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  date: Date,
  location: String,
  createdBy: ObjectId,
  attendees: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### ✅ 3. Diagramming Tools

- dbdiagram.io
- drawSQL
- MongoDB Compass
- NoSQL Workbench

### ✅ 4. Relationship Mapping

- One-to-Many: User → Events, User → Jobs
- Many-to-Many: Users ↔ Connections
- One-to-One: User ↔ Profile

### ✅ 5. Indexing Strategy

- Index on `email` (unique)
- Compound index for sorting: `graduationYear + department`
- Text index on bios and job descriptions

### ✅ 6. Data Validation

- In DB: Mongoose validation
- In API Layer: Zod / Joi

## 🌀 Step 2: System Architecture

### 🔷 High-Level Design (HLD)

- **Architecture:** Monolithic
- **Modules:**
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - User & Role Management
  - Event Management
  - Job Board
  - Messaging & Notifications
  - Donations
  - Admin Dashboard

### 🧩 Low-Level Design (LLD)

- **API Contracts:** REST (Swagger or Postman)
- **Frontend Components:** Broken down by module
- **Middlewares:** auth, validation, error handling, rate-limiting, logging
- **DB Schema (MongoDB collections):** users, events, jobs, messages, logs, connections
